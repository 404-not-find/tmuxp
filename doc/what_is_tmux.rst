.. _what_is_tmux:

Explain tmux like to me like I'm 5
==================================

First, it is appropriate to place things in context.

In the world of computers, there are many dimensions:

1. The text dimension
2. The graphical dimension

Today, thanks to the power of things like fermi, the graphical dimension
of computers boot into games that transmute like 300 trillion polygons a
second.

This is about the text dimension. This is about fixed-width fonts and that
old fashioned black terminal.

tmux is like... launching a window manager like KDE, gnome, inside the
text dimension. Tmux let's a terminal:

- multitask inside of a terminal, run multiple applications
- have multiple command lines in the same window
- have multiple windows in the workspace
- switch between workspaces, like virtual desktops
