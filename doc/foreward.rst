Explain tmux like to me like I'm 5
----------------------------------

First, it is appropriate to place things in context.

tmux is geared for technical users who make heavy use of text-based
interfaces. If you are interested in starting to learn Linux / OS X better
as a future programmer or system administrator - welcome.

In the world of computers, there are many dimensions:

1. The text dimension
2. The graphical dimension

Today, thanks to the power of things like fermi, the graphical dimension
of computers boot into games that transmute like 300 trillion polygons a
second.

This is about the text dimension. This is about fixed-width fonts and that
old fashioned black terminal.

tmux is to the consle what a graphical environment like your desktop in
os x, windows or linux, but inside the text dimension. Inside tmux you
can:

- multitask inside of a terminal, run multiple applications
- have multiple command lines in the same window
- have multiple windows in the workspace
- switch between workspaces, like virtual desktops

For users with some command line experience
-------------------------------------------

If you are a UNIX user, use command line and don't yet use a multiplexer,
like byoubu, screen or tmux, I'm excited to introduce you to tmux.

For GNU/screen user

For users of GNU screen
