For new programmers and system admins
-------------------------------------

tmux is geared for technical users who make heavy use of text-based
interfaces. If you are interested in starting to learn Linux / OS X better
as a future programmer or system administrator - welcome.

In the world of computers, there are many dimensions:

1. The text dimension
2. The graphical dimension

This is the text dimension. This is about fixed-width fonts and that old
fashioned black terminal.

tmux is to the consle what a graphical environment like your desktop in
os x, windows or linux, but inside the text dimension. Inside tmux you
can:

- multitask inside of a terminal, run multiple applications
- have multiple command lines in the same window
- have multiple windows in the workspace
- switch between workspaces, like virtual desktops

For users with CLI experience
-----------------------------

If you are a UNIX/BSD/Linux/OS X user, use command line and don't yet use
a multiplexer, like byoubu, screen or tmux, I'm excited to introduce you
to tmux.

For GNU/screen user
